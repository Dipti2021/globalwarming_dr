# Global Temperature Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

## 🌐 Overview

This project aims to predict global temperatures using various machine learning models. The data is sourced from NASA's [GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4)](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/). The dataset includes global mean monthly, seasonal, and annual temperature records from 1880 to the present. Multiple models are utilized to predict and analyze temperature trends, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, RNN, SVR, and Gradient Boosting.
